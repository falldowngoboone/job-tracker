job-tracker
===========

This is a tiny little AngularJS project I've been working on to get the hang of Angular. It's an update list based on a multi-client, multi-project work flow. It's horribly primitive, so please forgive the lack of style, function, etc. It's a work in progress.

To run this, you must have a PHP server running in the background. In a Linux/Unix environment, in your Terminal, cd into the job tracker directory and type:

php -S localhost:8000

Now you can navigate to localhost:8000 in your browser. I ended up creating a .command file to do this for me. It's more convenient.

Note: It may or may not work without a data directory. I'll need to run some tests. Please don't yell at me too much. Again, work in progress!
